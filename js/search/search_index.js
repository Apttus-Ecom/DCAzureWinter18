dropdown menu. The cart icon should be displayed in a fixed header of a page so it is accessible to the user at all times. Once items have been added to the user's current cart a badge will appear next to the Mini Cart icon with the total number of items.\nWhen a user clicks the Mini Cart icon the associated dropdown menu will be displayed. The Mini Cart dropdown menu shows the current line items that have been added to the cart. Line items include information about the product, controls for updating the quantity of items, and a control for removing the item from the cart. A cart total price and checkout button are also shown in the Mini Cart dropdown.\nExample Usage:\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Implements\n    \n    \n                OnInit\n                OnDestroy\n

this guide is to provide technical instructions on the installation and setup of an Apttus E-Commerce storefront. The intended audience are developers who will be creating and maintaining new storefronts on a Salesforce Apttus installation. If you haven't already, please contact Apttus to get the E-Commerce package installed in your org prior to installation.\nCreate your first Storefront\nThe Apttus E-Commerce SDK is intended to work with the unified data model of the underlying Apttus Quote-to-cash platform. This means, there are no additional data setup steps in order to create and maintain your catalog within Apttus outside of what you may already do if you use Apttus CPQ. That said, this guide assumes you have already created data for the following within Apttus:\n\nCategory\nProduct\nPrice List\n\nCommunity Setup\nThe Apttus E-Commerce platform leverages a Salesforce Community to provide authentication and hosting features for guest users. After the e-commerce package is deployed, the next step is to create a Salesforce Community. At minimum, you just need the community URL. However, if you intend to support guest users, you will need to enable that within the community settings. After deployment, the angular library will provide a Visualforce page that you can set as the default page for all page settings within the community (i.e home, login, forgot password, change password etc). Being that its a single page application, it is designed to handle all incoming requests.\nStorefront Object\nApart from the underlying catalog, the E-Commerce package comes with a store object and tab to map a storefront to a catalog. If you are using an Apttus MDO org, there may already be a 'store' object installed. This object is deprecated in favor of the 'Storefront' object that comes with the E-Commerce package.\nAfter your catalog has been setup within Apttus, the next step is to create a 'Storefront' record. The storefront object is very basic and contains only a couple fields to map a storefront to a price list and logo for the guest user. The price list should look up to the price list you want the guest user to access and the logo should be an id or a url of the logo attachment for the store. The storefront record also has a 'banner' related list that can be used to setup banners for the jumbotron component in the reference template.  Remember the name of the storefront you created. This will be used in a later step to associate with a storefront codebase.\nApttus Ecommerce Permission Set\nThe E-Commerce package comes with a basic permission set for providing the necessary access to users. The permission set is named 'Apttus Ecommerce' and should be assigned to users access the e-commerce storefront. If you would like to make any changes to the permissions, you may clone the permission set and make any changes necessary. \nAngular Library Installation\nIn order to install the apttus ecommerce library, you must first be granted access. Please reach out to Apttus support for obtaining access to this library.\nTo install this library, run:\nnpm install @apttus/ecommerce --saveDuring installation, you will be asked for a number of things to connect the application to your salesforce org (will be skipped if you already installed ng-salesforce).\nand then from your Angular AppModule:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import your library\nimport { ApttusModule } from '@apttus/core';\nimport { CommerceModule } from '@apttus/ecommerce';\n\n// salesforce.config.ts will be created during installation and saved at src/app/salesforce.config.ts\nimport { Configuration } from './salesforce.config';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n\n    // Specify your ng-salesforce as an import\n    ApttusModule.forRoot(Configuration),\n\n    // Specify the Ecommerce Module as in import\n    // The only parameter is the string name of the APTSMD_Store__c record you want to use.\n    CommerceModule.forRoot('My Store')\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Once your library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:\nDefining a model\nProper state management is crucial to a successful Angular PWA. To that end, accessing data within Salesforce requires you to define your model\nwithin a Typescript class. Behind the scenes, ng-salesforce is managing how your components access and interact with that data to avoid uncessary\noperations and maintain synchronicity. \nHere's an example that defines the account and contact relationship for a component.\nimport { ATable, SObject, ChildRecord } from 'ng-salesforce';\n\n// We use the decorator ATable to tell ng-salesforce this class maps to the 'Account' object\n// In order to access standard sObject fields, our Account class must extend 'SObject'\n// The class name can be anything, but the name property in the ATable decorator must map to an object API name\n@ATable({name : 'Account'})             \nexport class Account extends SObject{         \n\n  // Define the fields you would like in your object.

The SObjectService class contains many of the standard DML and query operations to access the data, however you may add\nany convenience methods you want to your service. The core service methods are usually very simple.\nimport { SObjectService } from 'ng-salesforce';\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Account } from './account.model.ts'  // This is a reference to the account model created in the previous section\n\n\n@Injectable({\n    providedIn : 'root'\n})\nexport class AccountService extends SObjectService{\n  //Add service methods here\n  type = Account;\n}Access the data in your component\nimport { Component, OnOnit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AccountService } from './account.service.ts';\nimport { Account } from './account.model.ts';\n\n@Component({\n  selector : 'app-account',\n  template : `\n\n  `,\n  styles : [``]\n})\nexport class AccountComponent implements OnInit{\n\n  constructor(private accountService: AccountService){}\n\n  // Always perform service methods in the ngOnInit method\n  ngOnInit(){\n    this.accountService.where(`Id <> NULL LIMIT 1`).subscribe(res => {\n      /*\n      res === [\n        {\n          Name : 'Account A',\n          IsCustomerPortal : false,\n          My_Custom_Field__c : 1,\n          Id : 'xxx',\n          ...\n          Opportunities : {\n            totalSize : 1,\n            records : [\n              Name : 'Opportunity A',\n              AccountId : 'xxx',\n              Id : 'xxx',\n              ...\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n      */\n    });\n    this.accountService.describe('My_Custom_Field__c', false).subscribe(res => {\n      // Describe information for My_Custom_Field__c\n    });\n\n    this.accountService.search(`FIND 'map*' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account (Id, Name)`).subscribe(res => {\n      // SOSL Search Results\n      // Note : search does not follow the model pattern and will return results specified in the query\n    });\n\n    this.accountService.get(['00Fxxxxxxx', '00Fxxxxxxx']).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns an array of account records\n    })\n\n    this.accountService.aggregate(`ID <> NULL`).subscribe(res => {\n      // Returns aggregates for the specified clause.

This won't be an issue when you deploy to production.\nHowever, during development you will see this error for calls to the SOAP API. To bypass this, you must setup a proxy in @angular/cli. \nFix: Setup @angular/cli proxy\nFirst, create a file called 'proxy.conf.json' in your root directory. This json file will look like the following:\n{\n  \"/services/Soap/*\": {\n    \"target\": \"https://my.community.url.force.com\",\n    \"secure\": false,\n    \"logLevel\": \"debug\",\n    \"changeOrigin\": true\n  }\n}\nMake sure you set the target to be the community url you are using.\nSecondly, point your angular.json configuration to this newly created proxy configuration.\n{\n  ...\n  \"projects\" : {\n    ...\n    \"myProject\" : {\n      ...\n      \"architect\" : {\n        ...\n        \"serve\" : {\n          ...\n          \"options\" : {\n            ...\n
